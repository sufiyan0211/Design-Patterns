# Design Patterns
This Repository is created for learning Design Patterns in Java.


## Creational Design Pattern
### Singleton Pattern
* Ensure that only one instance of a class is created and provides the global point of access to that instance.


### Builder Pattern 
* Simplify the creation of complex objects with many optional parameters.

### Factory Pattern
* Dynamically create objects based on input or configuration.

### Bridge Pattern
* Decouples an abstraction from its implementation, so that the two can vary independently.

### Prototype Pattern
* Creates new objects by clonning an existing object, rather than creating a new instance from scratch.

## Structural Design Pattern
### Adpater Pattern
* convert the interface of a class to another interface that clients expects.

### Bridge Pattern
* Decouple an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently.


## Behavioural Design Pattern
### Observer Pattern
* Notify multiple objects when the state of another object changes.
